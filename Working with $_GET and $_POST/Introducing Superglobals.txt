Introducing Superglobals $_GET and $_POST
A PHP superglobal is an associative array of data that's created by the server to capture information from URLs, HTML forms, cookies, sessions, and web servers. It's called a "superglobal" because the information in the array is available everywhere in your script.

Superglobals can be used globally without typing global $variable; which means they are available inside of functions or methods by default. How superglobally cool is that?

You may have seen or even used PHP superglobals if you've worked with persistent session data, HTML forms, or when working with cookies. For a complete list of superglobals check out the PHP Manual.

In this course, you'll learn about the $_GET and $_POST superglobals which are used to capture information from forms and URLs. After finishing this stage, you'll be able to:

Build a simple HTML form
Use $_GET and $_POST superglobals with forms
echo variables using query strings with $_GET
echo variables without using query strings with $_POST
